compile:
    _info:
        title: Compile a YAML pod spec into a standalone self managed executable.
    _env:
        - name:
            title: Name of the pod when created.
            desc: |
                For podman runtimes this is the name of the pod container and suffix of other containers.
        - inFile:
            title: YAML file containing the spec to compile into an executable. Default is pod.yaml.
            value: ${infile:-pod.yaml}
        - outFile:
            title: The output file (this also gives the target directory)
        - srcDir:
            title: Source directory of the pod.yaml file.
            desc: |
                If the inFile is not located where the original pod.yaml file is (which could happen on an outside preprocessing event)
                then we need to provide the source dir if compiling an executable runtime, since it looks for "./bin".
        - doPreprocessing:
            title: Preprocess and variable substitute pod.yaml file before compiling. Default true.
        - RUN: COMPILE_ENTRY -- "${name}" "${inFile}" "${outFile}" "${srcDir}" "${doPreprocessing}"

cmdline:
    _info:
        title: Use podc as a standalone cmd line tool
    _env:
        - RUN: COMPILE_ENTRY -- "\$@"
